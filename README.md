## About

Inspired by crypto currencies and the love of fetching data from `free` :) Api services,
I decided to learn new technologies like redux toolkit, 3rd party UI based libraries like `antd`
and apply it in building the Crypton crypto data awareness web app.   

### `Technologies Applied`

.React <br/>
.redux <br/>
.redux-toolkit <br/>
.antd (For custom UI components) <br/>
.RapidApi (For fetching: Crypto, Crypto details and Crypto news data)
